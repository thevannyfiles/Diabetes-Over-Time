# Diabetes Over Time

Description: The "Diabetes Over Time" project is a comprehensive analysis of diabetes prevalence trends over the years, focusing on gender disparities worldwide. The project utilizes data provided by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, a valuable source for understanding the global burden of non-communicable diseases.

### Key Objectives:

1. <b>Data Collection:</b> The project begins by collecting and organizing data from the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration. This dataset contains valuable information about diabetes prevalence and related factors across different regions and time periods.

2. <b>Temporal Analysis:</b> The primary objective is to analyze the prevalence of diabetes over time. This involves examining trends, fluctuations, and patterns in diabetes rates across various years.

3. <b>Gender Disparities:</b> A specific focus of the project is to investigate gender disparities in diabetes prevalence. By comparing data between men and women, the project aims to identify any significant differences in diabetes rates and trends.

4. ****Data Visualization:**** To effectively communicate the findings, the project uses data visualization tools such as Excel, Python, and Google Colab Notebook. Visualizations help present complex trends and patterns in an accessible format.

5. ****Statistical Analysis:**** Statistical methods are employed to assess the significance of gender-based differences in diabetes prevalence. Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals may be used to draw robust conclusions.

6. ****Insight Generation:**** The project generates insights into how diabetes has evolved over time and whether there are notable variations between genders. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions.

### Tools Used:

1. ****Excel:**** For data preprocessing, organization, and initial exploratory analysis.

2. ****PowerPoint:**** To create visually engaging presentations of the project's findings.

3. ****Python:**** For advanced data analysis, statistical testing, and data visualization.

4. ****Google Colab Notebook:**** An interactive platform for collaborative data analysis and Python scripting.

5. ****Word:**** For comprehensive documentation and reporting of the project's methods, findings, and conclusions.

By analyzing the prevalence of diabetes over time and examining gender disparities, this project contributes valuable information to the field of global health. The insights gained can be instrumental in shaping strategies and policies to combat diabetes and improve public health outcomes on a global scale.
